# HSI---Silver-Identification-and-Depth-Identification: 
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on object identification and depth estimation in a water medium using Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and Machine Learning algorithms. Silver, Gold, and Bronze objects were placed in a 3-feet water tank at varying depths (0 ft, 1 ft, 1.5 ft, and 2 ft). Using an HSI camera, spectral signatures were captured, and algorithms were applied to identify objects and estimate depth.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Identify Silver, Gold, and Bronze objects using HSI.

Perform depth detection at multiple water levels.

Compare performance of HSI algorithms and ML models.
